This repo consists of the materials used for the Study Jam 2.0 webinar that I gave on the topic "Growing Decision Trees".
For explanation of the concepts, please refer to the file 'growing-decision-trees-session.pptx' & for detailed theoretical understanding, you can go through the video presentation file 'decision-trees-session.mp4'.

The Python implementation is provided in the file 'decision-trees.ipynb' & the rest of the files and directory structure are a consequent of the code implementation. The details of each of the artifacts are explained in the video presentation.
